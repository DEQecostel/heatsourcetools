\description{
Read flow rate outputs from the hydraulics output worksheet in a Heat Source
version 7 model. The Heat Source excel workbook needs to be saved as .xlsm.
Workbooks in .xls do not seem to work.
}
\details{
Data is returned in wide format with the model stream km used as the column
name for all values. An "X" is added as a prefix to every stream km value to
have syntactically valid column names. The datetime is the first column and
is formatted in excel numeric date format. Heat Source 7 has a bug where the
dates in the hydraulics output worksheet are one day off. This function works
around this bug and returns the correct date for each result.

This function is setup to read the "Output - Hydraulics" worksheet.
